# Learning

## About
This repository contain many idea to training  my skill in coding. This repository published  because i think it might interesting for other. The idea it self come from many sources
<br />
<br />
This repository contain many topic so i will give an introduce some of them in this REDME file

### Challenge - [`link`](https://github.com/hudhanst/learning/tree/master/Challenge)
##### About
This folder contain some challenges from many sources arrange by source/account/publishdate
<br />
usually the challenge is to creat some function to certain some goal. a challenge description can be found on file itself

### TicTacToe - [`link`](https://github.com/hudhanst/learning/tree/master/TicTacToe)
##### About
recreate TicTacToe game on python
##### How it Work?
well it just a conditional programming, an interesting things is i add a computer move that calculate your move, a computer will try to stop you for win
##### Devlopment plant
- add machine learning algorithm or any algorithm
- add GUI
### 41CardGame - [`link`](https://github.com/hudhanst/learning/tree/master/41CardGame)
##### About
recreate 41CardGame game on python<br/>
if you didnt know this game, this is a card game when play you and 4 of people ech one of you try to collage 41point (A=11, K=10, Q=10, J=10 and 10=10) with same shape and collor you can only have 4 card in hand ech turn end so you must throw one card to player next to you and in the beginning  of next player turn he can draw from deck or take a card you throw on him. If some one collage 41 point he won else if deck run out the player with most point win. a diferent shape in hand count as - (minus) to general point, player dicaide wich shape he want
##### How it Work?
well it just a conditional programming, an interesting things is i add a computer move that calculate what card they have in their hand and, count what card alredy throw and count possibility they have with that kind situation
##### Devlopment plant
- add machine learning algorithm or any algorithm
- add GUI
### Machine Learning - [`link`](https://github.com/hudhanst/learning/tree/master/Machine%20Learning)
##### About
- Dicoding<br/>
image recognition/classification. Dataset contain image of rock, paper and scissors<br/>
goal: create model with accuration higher then 60% and also a program has file test system so user can test by upload image and receive result of uploaded image
- Digital Talent Scholarship
    - MidTest
        - House<br/>
        regression analysis. Dataset contain information about features in a house<br/>
        goal: create model to predict price of a house
        - Iris<br/>
        classification. Dataset contain iris data table<br/>
        goal: create model with 1 of 3 classification algorithmic and create using the best
        - Titanic<br/>
        classification. Dataset contain information about survivor<br/>
        goal: use classification algorithmic to predict wich one survive
    - FinalTest<br/>
    image recognition/classification. Dataset fashion MNIST, contain 55000 training set, 10000 test set and 10 category<br/>
    goal: make a report about this project, and also as good as it can
##### Devlopment plant
- Fix Digital Talent Scholarship project ( when i create dicoding project i am looking for example, there when i notcie some of function i use alredy unusable)
- learn more about machine learning and deep learning, so interesting
